Designed for employees or administrators working at colleges to handle student and course data. It offers a range of features that enable users to view different information about students and courses, such as the most popular majors, courses, degrees, and students from various states and countries.
 
The website's functionality is simple yet effective. An administrator can add a student with basic information about their contact, address, and degree. Once the student is added, an automatic unique ID is assigned to the student, and a unique email is generated based on their first and last name.

If a student is no longer attending college, they can be marked as inactive, with reasons such as taking a break or already having graduated. This allows the administrator to keep an accurate record of active students and reactivate them when they return. The same procedure is followed for courses where administrators can update or delete any course, as necessary.

Another feature of the website is its ability to view a student's credit and course information, providing a comprehensive overview of their academic progress!
